    "## Why is deep learning important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning methods are a form of **artificial intelligence (AI)** or **machine intelligence**. More sepecifically, deep learning algorithms are a type of **machine learning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What properties does machine intelligene require? There have been many answers to this question over the history of computing. In this case, we will take a practical view, sometimes known as **weak AI**. There are three key properties an intelligent machine must have. Deep learning algorithms are one of a few classes of algorithms that can do the following, essential to machine intelligence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Representaion:** An intelligent machine must be able to represent a model of the world it interacts with in a general manner. In conventional machine learing the representation is model and a set of features. The representation is limited to what the features can provide directly. Deep learning algorithms, on the other hand, learn learn complex representations from raw features. This behavior allows deep learning algorithms to approximate complex relationships. Further, the representations learned often generalize well, up to a point. \n",
    "2. **Learning:** As you likely guessed from the very name, deep learning algorithms learn from data. Whereas, conventional machine learning is focused on inference,deep learning algorithms learn both inferencce and representations. As a result, deep leaning algorithms are more complex and therefore harder to train than conventional machine learning algorithms.  \n",
    "3. **Inference:** Any machine intelligence algorithm must be able to perform inference. The inference is the result produced given new input data. To be useful, the inferences produced by a machine intelligence algorithm must **generalize** beyond the cases used for learning or training. Good generalization requires both good represenations and learning which can deal with the complexity of diverse situations. Some deep learning algorithms can approach human levels of performance in inference tasks such as recognizing objects in images or understanding natural speach. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! The entire rest of this course will just focus on these three points!"
