    "This notebook will provides a first look at using the Keras package to define, train and evaluate deep learning models with Keras. By the end of this lesson you will be able to work with basic feedforward architecture multi-layer neural nets. Feedforward networks are one of a class of basic models called **sequential models** which are easy to define with Keras. Further, some basic regularization is introduced. Additional regularization methods are covered in a subsequent lesson. \n",
